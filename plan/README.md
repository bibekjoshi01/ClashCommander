# Project Execution Plans

This folder contains phase-by-phase execution plans designed for parallel team execution.

## How to Use
- Each phase has its own `README.md`.
- Within each phase, work is split into independent member tracks.
- Members should only depend on published contracts, not internal implementation.
- Phase completion requires all track-level acceptance criteria to pass.
